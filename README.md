## Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge

For my [General Assembly Data Science](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science) class project, I competed in [Kaggle's Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge](http://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge).

* [Project paper](allstate-paper.md) (Markdown document)
* [R code](allstate-code.R)
* [Blog post](http://www.dataschool.io/kaggle-allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge/)
* Presentation
	* [Recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGr1yQV3Um0)
	* [Slides on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/justmarkham/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge-on-kaggle)
	* [PDF](allstate-presentation.pdf) or [PowerPoint](allstate-presentation.pptx)

There is a thread on the Kaggle forums in which competitors are [sharing their solutions](http://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge/forums/t/8218/solution-sharing), and another thread in which you can [provide feedback on my paper](http://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge/forums/t/8222/i-wrote-a-paper-on-the-allstate-competition-feedback-is-welcome/)!

Per the competition rules surrounding the sharing of code, I created this as a private repository and did not make it public until after the competition ended on May 19.
